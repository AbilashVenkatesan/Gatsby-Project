description: "<strong>Poutine</strong> is a <strong>Canadian dish</strong> made with french fries, cheese curds and topped with gravy. It emerged in <strong>Quebec, Canada,</strong> in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Qu√©bec region, though its origins are uncertain and there are several competing claims of having invented the dish. For many years it was perceived negatively and mocked, and even used by some to stigmatize Quebec society."
