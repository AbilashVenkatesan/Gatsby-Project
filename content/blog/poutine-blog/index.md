**Poutine** is a dish of **french fries** and **cheese curds** topped with a **brown gravy**. It emerged in Quebec, Canada, in the late 1950s in the [**Centre-du-Québec region,**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-du-Qu%C3%A9bec) though its origins are uncertain and there are several competing claims of having invented the dish. For many years it was perceived negatively and mocked, and even used by some to stigmatize Quebec society. Poutine later became celebrated as a **symbol of Québécois culture** and the province of Quebec. It has long been associated with Quebec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to popularity throughout the rest of Canada, in the northern United States, and internationally.

## History
### Origin

The dish was created in the **Centre-du-Québec area in the late 1950s**. Many restaurants have claimed to be the founder of the dish but **no solid proofs exists.**

1. **Le Lutin qui rit, [Warwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick,_Quebec)** – Restaurateur Fernand Lachance of Le Café Ideal (later Le Lutin qui rit), is said to have exclaimed in 1957, **"ça va faire une maudite poutine!"** (English: "It will make a damn mess!") when asked by a regular to put a handful of cheese curds in a take-out bag of french fries. The dish "poutine" appears on the establishment's 1957 menu. Lachance served this on a plate, and beginning in 1962 added **hot gravy to keep it warm.**
2. **Le Roy Jucep, [Drummondville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummondville)** – This drive-in restaurant served french fries with gravy, to which some customers would add a side order of cheese curds. Owner Jean-Paul Roy began serving the combination in 1958 and added it to the menu in 1964 as **"fromage-patate-sauce".** Felt to be too long a name, this was later changed to poutine for a cook nicknamed **"Ti-Pout"** and a slang word for **"pudding".** The restaurant displays a copyright registration certificate, issued by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, which alludes to Roy having invented poutine.
3. **La Petite Vache, [Princeville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeville,_Quebec)** – Customers would mix cheese curds with their fries, a combination which was added to the menu. One option included gravy and was called the **"Mixte"**.

### Further Developments

Poutine was consumed in small **"greasy spoon"** diners (commonly known in Quebec as cantines or casse-croûtes), pubs, at roadside chip wagons *(commonly known as cabanes à patates, literally "potato shacks")* and in hockey arenas. For decades it remained a country snack food in Quebec's dairy region, due to the narrow freshness window of cheddar cheese curds. In 1969, poutine was brought to Quebec City in *Ashton Leblond's* food truck *(a business which grew into the Chez Ashton fast-food chain).* In the early 1970s, *La Banquise* began serving poutine in Montreal, followed by the Burger King chain in 1983. Others that followed used inferior cheese and the dish's reputation declined. Poutine was largely perceived as an unsophisticated backwoods creation or unhealthy junk food to be consumed after a night of drinking.

### Receipe

##### Ingredients

- **French fries:** These are usually of medium thickness and fried (often twice) such that the inside stays soft, while the outside is crispy.
- **Cheese curds:** Fresh cheese curds are used to give the desired texture. The curd size varies, as does the amount used.
- **Brown gravy:** Traditionally, it is a light and thin chicken gravy, somewhat salty and mildly spiced with a hint of pepper; or a sauce brune, which is a combination of chicken and beef stock. Poutine sauces (mélange à sauce poutine) are sold in Quebec, Ontario, and Maritime grocery stores in jars or cans and in powdered mix packets; some grocery chains offer their own house-brand versions. Many stores and restaurants also offer vegetarian gravy.

##### Process

To maintain the texture of the fries, the cheese curds and gravy are added immediately before serving the dish. The hot gravy is usually poured over room-temperature cheese curds, so they are warmed without melting completely. The thin gravy allows all the fries to be coated. The serving dish typically has some depth to act as a basket for the fries so that they retain their heat. It is important to control the temperature, timing, and the order in which the ingredients are added to obtain the right food textures—an essential part of the experience of eating poutine.

Freshness and juiciness of the curds is essential. Air and moisture seep out of the curds over time, altering their acidity level. This causes proteins to lose their elasticity, and the curds to lose their complex texture and characteristic squeaky sound when chewed. The curds should be less than a day old, which requires proximity to a dairy. While Montreal is 60 kilometres *(37 mi)* from a cheese plant in Mirabel, restaurants and specialty cheese shops outside of dairy regions may be unable to sell enough curds to justify the expense of daily deliveries. Furthermore, Canadian food safety practices require curds to be refrigerated within 24 hours, which suppresses the properties of their texture. This has resulted in poutineries which specialize in the dish; busy poutineries may use 100 kilograms *(220 lb)* of curds per day. Poutineries which are too distant from dairies may make their own cheese curds on site, in batches every few hours, to ensure a fresh and steady supply.
