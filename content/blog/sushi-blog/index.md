**Sushi** (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared **vinegared rice** (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as **seafood, often raw, and vegetables.** Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is **"sushi rice",** also referred to as **shari** (しゃり), or **sumeshi** (酢飯).

**Sushi** is traditionally made with **medium-grain white rice,** though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as **squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat.** Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with **pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce.** Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular **garnishes for the dish.**

**Sushi** is sometimes confused with **sashimi,** a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.

## History
### Origin

A dish known as **narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"),** stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish. The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The process can be traced back to the early domestication of rice in the **neolithic cultures of China,** fermentation methods following similar logic in other asian rice cultures include: **[Pla ra (ปลาร้า)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pla_ra), [Burong isda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burong_isda), [Sikhae (식해).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhae)** The [lacto-fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid_fermentation) of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the **Yayoi period,** lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the next months, and Narezushi became an important source of **protein for Japanese consumers.** The term sushi literally means **"sour-tasting"** and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour"; the overall dish has a **sour and umami or savoury taste.** Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from [Shiga Prefecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiga_Prefecture).

### Receipe

##### Ingredients

1. **Sushi-Meshi:** Sushi-meshi is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and sake. Traditionally, it is mixed with a hangiri (a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel) and a shamoji (a wooden paddle).
2. **Noir:** The black seaweed wrappers used in makimono are called nori. Nori is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making rice paper.
3. **Gu:** The ingredients used inside sushi are called gu, and are, typically, varieties of fish. For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection.
4. **Condiments:** Sushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu (soy sauce), and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the Wasabia japonica plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork and other sushi cuts.

##### Process

Traditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine.

Many sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets, selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as shō-chiku-bai (松竹梅), shō/matsu (松, pine), chiku/take (竹, bamboo) and bai/ume (梅, plum), with matsu the most expensive and ume the cheapest. Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept.

Meat sushi
Sushi may be served kaiten zushi (sushi train) style. Color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt; as the belt passes, customers choose as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer kaiten zushi restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared.

There is a practice called nyotaimori which entails serving the sushi on the naked body of a woman.
